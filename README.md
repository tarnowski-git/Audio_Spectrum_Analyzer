git clone ...

Install requests, a common module to handle HTTP requests, you’d simply use the following command from the root directory of your project:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
pip will then take care of the rest and install the package.

### Usage
```$ python spectrum_analyzer.py```

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Displays the waveform with matplotlib
* Spectrum viewer using scipy.fftpack to compute the FFT
